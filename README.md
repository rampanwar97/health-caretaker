# Health Monitoring Dashboard

A modern, real-time health monitoring application built with Go that allows you to monitor HTTP/HTTPS endpoints and view their status through a beautiful web interface.

## Features

- üöÄ **Real-time Monitoring**: Monitor multiple HTTP/HTTPS endpoints simultaneously
- üìä **Beautiful Dashboard**: Modern, responsive web UI with real-time updates
- üîÑ **WebSocket Support**: Live status updates without page refresh
- ‚ö° **Fast & Lightweight**: Built with Go for high performance
- üê≥ **Docker Ready**: Easy deployment with Docker and Docker Compose
- üîß **Configurable**: Customizable check intervals, timeouts, and HTTP methods
- üì± **Mobile Friendly**: Responsive design that works on all devices

## Quick Start

### Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```
3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`

### Manual Build and Run

1. Make sure you have Go 1.21+ installed
2. Download dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod download
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`

## Usage

### Adding Endpoints

1. Fill out the "Add New Endpoint" form:
   - **Name**: A friendly name for your endpoint
   - **URL**: The HTTP/HTTPS URL to monitor
   - **Method**: HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD)
   - **Check Interval**: How often to check (5-3600 seconds)
   - **Timeout**: Request timeout (1-60 seconds)

2. Click "Add Endpoint" to start monitoring

### Monitoring Features

- **Real-time Status**: See live status updates (UP/DOWN/CHECKING)
- **Response Time**: Monitor endpoint response times
- **Status Codes**: View HTTP status codes
- **Error Messages**: See detailed error information when endpoints are down
- **Manual Checks**: Trigger immediate checks with "Check Now" button
- **Remove Endpoints**: Delete endpoints you no longer need to monitor

### Status Indicators

- üü¢ **UP**: Endpoint is responding successfully (2xx-3xx status codes)
- üî¥ **DOWN**: Endpoint is not responding or returning error status codes
- üü° **CHECKING**: Currently performing a health check

## API Endpoints

The application provides a REST API for programmatic access:

- `GET /api/endpoints` - Get all monitored endpoints
- `POST /api/endpoints` - Add a new endpoint
- `DELETE /api/endpoints/{id}` - Remove an endpoint
- `POST /api/endpoints/{id}/check` - Manually trigger a check

### Example API Usage

Add a new endpoint:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/endpoints \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "My API",
    "url": "https://api.example.com/health",
    "method": "GET",
    "interval": 30,
    "timeout": 10
  }'
```

Get all endpoints:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/endpoints
```

## Configuration

The application runs on port 8080 by default. You can modify the port by changing the `port` variable in `main.go`.

### Environment Variables

- `PORT`: Server port (default: 8080)

## Docker Deployment

### Build and Run with Docker

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t health-monitor .

# Run the container
docker run -p 8080:8080 health-monitor
```

### Using Docker Compose

```bash
# Start the service
docker compose up -d

# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# Stop the service
docker compose down
```

## Security Considerations

- The application accepts self-signed certificates for HTTPS endpoints
- No authentication is implemented - consider adding authentication for production use
- The WebSocket connection allows all origins - restrict this for production

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or higher
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Dependencies

- `github.com/gorilla/mux` - HTTP router
- `github.com/gorilla/websocket` - WebSocket support

### Building

```bash
go build -o health-monitor main.go
```

### Running Tests

```bash
go test ./...
```
